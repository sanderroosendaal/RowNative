# Want to contribute?

This project is open for your contribution. You can contribute by

* Submitting Issues and improvement suggestions
* App development
* Test driving the app and giving feedback

# Development Guidelines

* Clone the Git repository to your local workspace
* Create a new branch off of "develop", name it "feature/yourfeature"
* Keep your branch limited to one feature, to keep feature development as independent as possible
* Once your functionality is complete, create a pull request for the complete branch
* Feel free to create pull requests for MVP type functionality. It is better to merge to develop often.
* We will review the code, and if approved, merge into the "develop" branch

Nobody approves their own pull request.

The code on the "main" branch is stable, properly tested, and is used for releases of the App.

The code on "develop" should be working, but without guarantees.

Refactoring work as well as renaming of functions and variables should be discussed in the group first. This prevents difficult merges. 

If you want to contribute, let us know. It helps if you add a little bit about your experience,
other projects you have contributed to, and motivation.
